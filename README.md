# FormalDinnerSorter

I can sort tables for you!

# Important Notice
A revision is completed, based on the following algorithm:

1. Get list of names
2. Generate tables
3. For student in names:

	a. Sort student by times served, descending
	
	b. Start with table w. Smallest number of people
	
	c. If can’t fit without expanding table — append name to last
	
	d. Last 38 names = staff
